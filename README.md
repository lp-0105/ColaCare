# ColaCare: Enhancing Electronic Health Record Modeling through Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration

ColaCare is a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-driven multi-agent collaboration. This project aims to improve clinical prediction tasks by combining the strengths of domain-specific expert models and general-purpose LLMs.

## What's New

🎉 [20 January 2025] Our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02551) is accepted by WWW 2025!

## Key Features

1. **EHR-Specific Multi-Agent Framework**: ColaCare integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data analysis and text-based reasoning capabilities.
2. **Collaborative Decision-Making Process**: The framework employs doctor agents and a meta doctor agent to simulate real-world medical consultations, ensuring comprehensive analysis of patient health records.
3. **Medical Guideline Support**: ColaCare incorporates authoritative medical guidelines using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, grounding predictions in current medical knowledge.
4. **Enhanced Predictive Performance**: Experiments on four real-world EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in mortality prediction tasks compared to existing EHR-specific models.
5. **Interpretable Insights**: The framework generates detailed, interpretable reports for each prediction, potentially revolutionizing clinical decision support systems.

## Environmental Setups

- Create an environment `colacare` and activate it.

```bash
conda create -n colacare python=3.9
conda activate colacare
```

- Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Local Small-LLM Smoke Test (No Clinical Data)

This smoke test uses one entirely fictional patient, one sequential DoctorAgent, no MetaAgent, no discussion, no RAG, and no EHR checkpoint. It validates the local software chain only; it does not reproduce the paper's metrics and is not clinical advice.

The default local configuration is Ollama plus `qwen3:4b`, context 4096, 256 output tokens, temperature 0, and reasoning disabled. From the repository root on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3:4b
python scripts/check_environment.py
python scripts/test_llm_api.py
python scripts/run_synthetic_smoke.py --stage single
ollama ps
```

Ollama normally runs with its Windows application. If the checks report that port 11434 is unreachable, start the local service with `ollama serve` in a separate terminal and repeat the commands.

Defaults are documented in `.env.example`. To switch to another OpenAI-compatible service such as vLLM, set `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL_NAME`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`, `LLM_CONTEXT_LENGTH`, and `LLM_TEMPERATURE` in the process environment. `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT=none` is also used locally so the model returns only the concise result. Do not commit a real `.env`.

Successful runtime results and logs are written to ignored `artifacts/smoke/single/`. The committed input is `tests/fixtures/synthetic_patient.json` and is marked as entirely fictional.

## Usage

### Training EHR models in pyehr

- Run the following command to train the EHR models and obtain feature importance scores in `pyehr` directory.

```bash
cd pyehr
python train_test.py
python importance.py
```

> More details about the pre-processing and training steps can be found in the [`pyehr`](https://github.com/yhzhu99/pyehr) repository.

### Running LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Write a configuration file for the multi-agent collaboration framework.

```python
# hparams.py

mimic_config = {
    "retriever_name" : "MedCPT",
    "corpus_name" : "MSD",
    "llm_name" : "deepseek-chat",
    "epochs" : 50,
    "patience" : 10,
    "ehr_dataset_name" : 'mimic-iv',
    "ehr_dataset_dir" : './ehr_datasets/mimic-iv/processed/fold_1',
    "ehr_model_names" : ['AdaCare', 'MCGRU', 'RETAIN'], 
    "seeds": [0, 0, 0],
    "doctor_num" : 3,
    "max_round" : 3,
    "ehr_embed_dim": 128,
    "text_embed_dim": 1024,
    "merge_embed_dim": 128,
    "learning_rate": 1e-3,
    "main_metric": "auprc",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "mode": "test"
}
```

- Run the following command to start the multi-agent collaboration framework.

```bash
python collaboration_pipeline.py
```

> The results can be found in the `response` directory.

### Training Fusion Network

- Run the following command to train the fusion network.

```bash
python utils/process_output.py
python train_fusion.py
```
